            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p> Usually how payment works is after you receive the estimate, you
                can either choose to accept or reject the price. If you choose we will draw up contracts that day for you
                to sign. In the contract it says that you will pay at least half up front, and the rest before the job is
                finished. Failure to pay the second half will result in a legal action. By the time we are 2/3 of the way
                through, all payments need to be paid or else we put a stop to the project. We work usually only in the
                Portland Metro area, anywhere further we do charge a travel fee.
                We respond as soon as possible; everyone’s business is
                important to us. You can either call us, and we’ll be right on top it or once we receive information that
                you’ve set up a estimate we will contact you as soon as possible. Usually no later than 24 hours unless it
                was set up on a day outside of operation hours. Our operation hours of are 7am to 7pm Monday to
                Friday.
