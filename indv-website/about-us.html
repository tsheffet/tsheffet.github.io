        <p>  We want to be your builder. Best in Concrete is a Family owned & ran
            business. <a href=#scale>Bill</a> Kalamafoni is the main owner of the company.  He runs all the operations, and the license
            for the company is ran under him. He over sees all sites. We have a team of contractors who are eager
            to come and run estimates. However, Bill is usually who meets with clients at first. Bill or <a href=#scale>Sue</a> (our office
            manager) usually will go over all contracts for jobs.
            Bill has an experienced team that works for him. All of Billâ€™s members have at least over 10 years of
            experience under their belt. We have been in business for over 30 years here in the <a href=#scale>Portland</a> area.We have a
            code of ethics. We pride ourselves in being honest, law abiding, and thoroughly safe through out the
            whole project.  </p>
